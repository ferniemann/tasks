# About this repository
<h3>What is this repository for?</h3>
As for now I am doing an online course on full stack web development, I will be working on many different tasks. This repository will help me organise them, hand them in and present them to the outside world. In the end, it probably won't do any harm letting you know what I've learnt and what I'm capable of, right?
